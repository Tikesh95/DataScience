Here's why it's important:\n",

If a researcher were to calculate the mean educational level and treat it as an interval variable, they might mistakenly interpret the result as a meaningful average level of education. However, since educational levels are ordinal, the mean may not accurately represent the central tendency, and applying certain statistical operations may not be appropriate."
