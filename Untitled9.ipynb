    "The close() function in Python is used to close an opened file. When you open a file using the open() function, system resources are allocated to maintain the connection between your program and the file on the disk.

    "Closing a file releases the system resources associated with it, such as file descriptors.\n",
    "Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks, particularly when dealing with a large number of files or in long-running programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Closing a file ensures that all the data that you wrote or buffered is properly flushed to the file on the disk.\n",
