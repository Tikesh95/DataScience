    "Abstraction - is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows you to focus on the essential aspects of an object while ignoring the non-essential details.\n",
    "OOP - In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by the derived classes. Interfaces, on the other hand, define a contract for a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface."
